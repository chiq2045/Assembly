3.1 Which registers hold the stack pointer, return address, and program counter?

SP - r13
RA - r14
PC - r15

3.5 (a) The following C statement declares an array of four integers, and initializes their values
to 7, 3, 21, and 10, in that order. Write the equivalent in GNU ARM assembly.
int nums[]={7,3,21,10};

nums:	.word 7,3,21,10

3.5 (b) Write the ARM assembly instructions to load all four numbers into registers r3 ,
r5 , r6 , and r9 , respectively, using: (ii) four ldr instructions.

ldr   r1, =num
ldr   r3, [r1, #0]
ldr   r5, [r1, #4]
ldr   r6, [r1, #8]
ldr   r9, [r1, #12]
